The LSTM
encodes an input time series signals sequentially into a
fixed length vector and then feeds it into a classifier.

常用时序模型比如LSTM进行识别，我们发现输入信号通常包含大量无用信息。在时间维度和传感器维度。
the final representation learned by recurrent networks
might encode some noise (irrelevant signal components,
unimportant sensor modalities, etc.). 

冻结步态(Freezing of gait，FOG)是帕金森病患者常见且致残的步态障碍，被定义为“企图行走时或前进过程中步伐短暂、突然地中止或明显减少”。
患者起始犹豫，不能行走或行走时感觉自己的脚像被 “粘”在地上，持续时间一般小于1分钟。冻结步态多发生于帕金森病的晚期.


For example, the abnormal signal of the freezing of gait
(FOG) [2] of Parkinson disease (Figure 1) only shows up
in a small time interval rather than in the entire window.
比如对于帕金森疾病的检测，这个活动只占时间窗口的一部分。

Different sensor modalities play different
roles for recognizing different activities [29, 26]. Using
unimportant sensors modalities may introduce substantial
noise into HAR.

For example, to detect FOG during walking,
the accelerometer is more important than the magnetometer.
And the sensor attached to the leg is more
important than that on the trunk

The gains in good
recognition results with RNNs have come at the cost of
interpretability. It is desirable to understand the underlying
basis for the decisions of neural models in HAR.


To address these issues, we propose
two attention models for human activity recognition: temporal
attention and sensor attention.

we propose to use sensor attention on the input
layer to fuse the sensor modalities based on their importance.


we apply
temporal attention LSTM to automatically ignore the unimportant
parts in the input signals and highlight the important
parts.


when applying attention through time, we notice
that continuous signals are more robust than discrete ones.
Thus, we propose a continuity constraint for the two attention
models
