Supplemental texts
Most of these texts are available from Carlson Library.  Most of them will be on reserve.  If you find one that isn’t on reserve, please don’t hog it forever.  Also, please note that this list is far from exhaustive. 

Programming Languages: Principles and Practice, third edition, by Kenneth Louden.  Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, 2011.  In the instructor’s opinion, the 2nd-best textbook on language design :-)
Concepts of Programming Languages, twelfth edition, by Robert Sebesta.  Addison-Wesley, 2018.  A popular but less comprehensive text. 
Essentials of Programming Languages, third edition, by Daniel Friedman, Mitchell Wand, and Christopher Haynes.  MIT Press, 2008.  A very different kind of PL text, and nicely done.  Based heavily on interpreters written in Scheme.  Excellent coverage of continuation-passing style. 
Engineering a Compiler, second edition, by Keith Cooper and Linda Torczon.  Morgan Kaufmann, 2011.  The new standard text in compiler design. 
Introduction to the Theory of Computation, third edition, by Michael Sipser.  Thomson (Course Technology), 2012.  The text for CSC 280.  Good source for coverage of finite automata and context free grammars, the theoretical basis for scanners and parsers. 
Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, fifth edition, by David Patterson and John Hennessy.  Morgan Kauffman, 2014.  The undisputed leader in undergraduate-level computer architecture textbooks. 
Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective, third edition, by Randy Bryant and David O’Hallaron.  Prentice Hall, 2016.  Sometimes used in place of Patterson & Hennessy as the CSC 252 textbook. 
The C++ Programming Language, fourth edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup.  Addision-Wesley, 2013.  Not necessarily the best text on C++, but pretty good, newly updated for C++’11, and written by the language designer. 
Tom Christiansen, brian d foy, Larry Wall, and Jon Orwant. Programming Perl, fourth edition.  O’Reilly Media, 2012.  The standard reference on the popular scripting language.
