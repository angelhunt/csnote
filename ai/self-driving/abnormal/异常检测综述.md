Anomalies due to positional
uncertainty are defined by the standard deviation of scaled
bounding boxes exceeding a predefined threshold. In addi-
tion, instances are considered anomalous due to class uncer-
tainty whenever the standard deviation of any class is above
the predefined threshold. But Bayesian segmentation net-
works are slow in inference due to their multiple forward
passes through the network with Monte Carlo dropout for
each frame.

## 标定

Platt scaling [24] is a simple post-hoc calibration method for binary
models, which transforms the logit using scalar parameters. 

Temperature scaling is the simplest
multi-class extension of Platt scaling and matrix and vector scaling are another two extensions of
platt scaling.

[40] proposes Mix-n-Match calibration strategies which mix parameter methods with
non-parameter methods. 

[25] explores the non-linear space for post-hoc calibration function using a
neural network.
