Hometown and hobby: I was born and grown in Shanghai and spent many summer and winter vacations in Changzhou where my most relatives lived. I was a naughty boy as a kid😊 Enjoy raising crickets and seeing them fight and did some damages (like to the waterways or walls) when trying to catch them. An athlete since primary school. Was first picked to play Table tennis at first grade. In several months, was asked to swim by another primary school coach. Months later, was asked to play soccer. Since then played soccer till now. The last formal team played was SJTU faculty team. At leisure, love to grow plants from Seeds, propagation and grafting. Though grown up in the center of Shanghai (Xikang road cross Nanjing road in Shanghai), but loved to be a peasant. Now you know why I choose my WeChat ID/name😊
 
Academic: Didn’t study much before middle school due to the theory of “no use to study”😊 The childhood was much happier compared to current kids who have to study even during weekends though we were much poorer in terms of accessing to food and etc. Formal study started about one year before high school. Self-motivated to study very hard in the last year before high school and not only caught up lot of missed but finished most high school content in one year. That one year I worked hardest in my lifetime but still felt enjoyable. Much harder than in high school and college! That is why I would like our campus hires to have the options to choose what to work on if possible. This is unique in STCA. I strongly believe passion is really powerful. My high school is associated with SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University). BA & MA both in SJTU. And SJTU is the first place I started work. Strong in Math, Physics and Chemistry. Very weak in Chinese😊 Sorry if I mispronounced some of your names☹ Enjoy proving theory and logic inference. Dislike experienced formular and calculation😊 This means dealing with ambiguity is not my strength and something I kept learning and improving😊
 
Companies worked: 8 companies including SJTU and MSFT. Other public companies: FairIssac (FICO), BBN Technology and Informix (bought by IBM). This is my 25th year at MSFT.
 
Top three values: Fairness, Teamwork, Quality. (Nothing good or bad for values. Can get quite emotional when seeing unfairness. Enjoy team work. Prefer small fish in a big lake vs large fish in a small pond. Why stay MSFT much longer. Enjoy working with smarter people like you😊 As an IC dev in security, I found more bugs during a bug bash and got top one in Windows Security. Rewarded a box of plastic bugs by Dave Thompson, who was WinSec Dir and became CVP for exchange later. Now you know why I emphasize so much on quality😊 EFS is feature almost bug free during Win 2000 famous standdown code reviews. No one has hacked EFS on domain environment to my knowledge though there were some fake news😊 An interesting story and lesson that good thing could turn bad. Due to the high quality and I actively filed bug against myself if I found, my tester hated me. Later, I learned tester KPI was number of bugs they found! Since then I would let my tester file any bug I found and that improved my relations with my tester😊)
 
Management style and personality self-assessment: Direct, transparent, planned, on time, perfectionist, careful, detailed, pessimistic. (Nothing good or bad here. If I hurt you because of direct and transparent, please let me know. I have no intention to hurt anyone but I could because of insensitivity and too direct☹ If you are a person more relaxed, you may find “planned, perfectionist, careful, detailed” annoying you. Let me know and we can negotiate to find common ground😊 I tend to plan the worst while expect the best and tend to stick to the original plan, if you are an optimistic. I like to complement with you😊)
 
When be at SZ: I am really looking forward to visiting SZ and seeing all of you F2F once I am allowed to enter into China safely. Hope USA can control COVID soon so that China will allow me in.
 
How to reach me: You can ping me anytime when you see me free online. I also have skip level 1:1s and you can ask Janice to arrange. If too long to wait, I will add slots. I also have “ask anything” session for IC only (I guarantee I will not tell your managers😊). You can also tell Janice you wish to join. I consider myself very responsive with emails. You are more than welcome to send me email to ask anything😊
