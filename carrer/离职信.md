With mixed feelings, I want to share that I have accepted a new role in WebXT â€“ Content Service team. The start day is Monday, July 26th. 

My journey in this team started almost 3 years ago. At the very beginning of Re-org, I used to worry a lot â€”â€” whatâ€™s the future of ODINML ? how will my career path be impacted ? But after several rounds of syncing up with Jane and Vincent. I settled myself down and focused on my features. Till today, ODINML has been running a critical role for many Data Scientists, it runs bigger, faster and smarter than ever, which is exact the vision Iâ€™ve been told. As to my career path, I also got many chances to grow,  skills on many aspects â€”â€” like Coding, Design, Communicating and Leadership. For some tough issues, Managersâ€™ guide and support also made me in my element doing my job. Looking back, I would say that now I grow up a stronger Data Engineer than before, which you could extrapolate managerâ€™s care from my experience.

It has been an incredible experience and I feel lucky to have been a member of big ODIN family. All the memorable experience, and all the people I have had the opportunity to work with â€”â€” those technical & design discussions and great Morale events â€”â€” are my precious memory.  THANK YOU for the great memories and the learning opportunities. 

Now, I decided to listen to my true mind and consolidated my interest to sail for a new direction â€”â€” Data Analysis. The good news is that my new journey is still Data-related, I have a vision that in the future we may collaborate again on some scenarios. 

Letâ€™s stay in touch,  stay connected. ðŸ˜Š

Thanks !
