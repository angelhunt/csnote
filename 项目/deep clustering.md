1. conven-tional clustering methods usually have poor performance onhigh-dimensional data, due to the inefficiency of similaritymeasures used in these methods
2. these meth-ods generally suffer from high computational complexity onlarge-scale dataset
3. For this reason, dimensionality reduc-tion and feature transformation methods have been exten-sively studied to map the raw data into a new feature space,where the generated data are easier to be separated by exist-ing classifiers. Principalcomponent analysis (PCA) [6] and non-linear transforma-tion such as kernel methods [7] and spectral methods
4. deep neuralnetworks (DNNs) can be used to transform the data intomore clustering-friendly representations due to its inherent property of highly non-linear transformation
5. revious work mainly focuses on feature trans-formation or clustering independently
